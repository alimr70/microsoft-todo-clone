# Microsoft's ToDo Clone

## Description / Short story

A usual project, when a junior programmer starts thinking of building a resume, is a to do list app. But the standard to do applications anyone make is too simple and I did not like this idea. So, I challenged myself and thought of something that normally I would not find a tutorial for it and more than a simple to do list. The thing which came to my mind was Microsoft ToDo because I use it frequently. So, I decided to build from scratch with my code. I built it with React (Hooks), React-Router, Redux for the front-end and used for the back-end authentication and saving userâ€™s data I used my Unified Auth project, which is the next project.

## Preview

## How To Install

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
https://github.com/alimr70/microsoft-todo-clone.git

cd microsoft-todo-clone

npm install

cd client & npm install

cd ../
```

### 2. Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials from the Google Cloud Platform and Twitter Developer Portal.

Visit the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.developers.google.com/) to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials such as a client ID and client secret that are known to both Google and your application.

### Don't forget to put the callback link in Google cloud platform:

- From the sidemenu click on Credentials
- Under "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" click on your project name
- Under "Authorized redirect URIs" > "URIs" write this uri "http://localhost:8080/auth/google/callback" then click on "ADD URI".

Visit the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) and do the same.

### Don't forget to put the callback link in Twitter Developer Portal:

- From the sidemenu click on your project name under "Projects and Apps" menu
- Scroll to "Authentication settings" and click on "Edit"
- Under "Authentication settings" > click on "Add another" write this uri "http://localhost:8080/auth/twitter/callback" then scroll to bottom and click "Save".

Don't store your client secret in your React app. You should store client secret in node app.

### 3. Client Side Setup

1. In the root of the client folder create a new file and name it ".env.local"

2. open `.env.local` file add

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL = http://localhost:8080
```

### 4. Server Side Environment Variables Setup

In the config folder of the server create a new file and name it "dev.env"

Now open the dev.env file and add the following:

```bash
PORT=8080
MONGO_URI=Your mongo db uri
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=value from google apis
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=value from google apis
CLIENT_URL = http://localhost:3000/
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = value from twitter developer portal
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = value from twitter developer portal
SECRET = Write your jsonwebtoken secret
```

### 5. Run 'dev' script

```bash
npm run dev
```
